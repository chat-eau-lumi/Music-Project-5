    #    cur_start_beat - what beat to start on if you are stopped
    #    cur_stop_beat - what beat to stop on if you have started (you can
    #       stop slightly late; generally you should not start any notes 
    #       at or after tm_stop_beat but you can play a short note on 
    #       tm_stop_beat if it is stylistically sensible.)
    #    cur_beats_per_measure - the current time signature as an integer
    #    cur_bps - current beats per second (the vtsched will implement this
    #       but reading the vtsched timemap slope is not reliable because
    #       vtsched may be updated instantaneously after this call.
    #    cur_scale - boolean array representing current scale
    #    cur_chord - boolean array representing current chord
    #    cur_bass - integer representing root of chord
    #
    # Use EPSILON here because comparing floats for equality is not
    #   reliable without very difficult analysis. So, instead of
    #   x >= y, we write x + EPSILON > y
